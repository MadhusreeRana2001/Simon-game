# Simon Game

This is a simple UI for playing the generic Simon game. It is built using vanilla Javascript and Bootstrap.

## Steps to play:

- Any key from the keyboard, preferably except the Space Bar, should be pressed to start the game.

- At Level 1, a random button, say blue, will flash, and the user should press that button to proceed to the second level.

- At Level 2, another button, say green, will flash, and the user has to remember the button in the previous level along with the current button, and has to click in the same order. So, here, the user has to click blue and then green to proceed to the next level. In this way, the order of levels increase.

- If, at any point, the user enters a wrong pattern, the game ends.

- 3 different sounds are played when a button flashes - one due to the level, another due to the user, and the third at the end of the game when the user enters a wrong pattern.

- Each button flash takes place with a white colour.
